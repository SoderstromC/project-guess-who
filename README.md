# Project Name

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

The assignment was to create a "Guess who?" game. A game where you win by guessing who the secret person is among an ensamble of different person cards and guess on personal attributes to filter among them and reduce the options.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

This week external factors significantly limited the time I had to spend on the project, therefore prioritisation was key. 
I choose to prioritise learning and understanding the code and use of functions, arrays and objects and to compromise on the style and additional add ons to the experience, such as audio. I decided I needed a clear plan and structure in order to reduce distractions. due to the limited time this week I also knew I would need imidate answers to questions to be able to progress within the timeline, hence taking help of my partner who has previous experience coding.

Plan:
- Spend majority of time on learning so that when I started coding I would be more efficient
- Plan the work: Define which problems I need to solve for, which problem to solve first and the remaining order, how to go about solving them 
- Coding approach - Test small learn fast. Small iterations, test it, debug or understand why it worked then move on to the next and google, google, google
- Taking help from my partner to debug when stuck, followed by walking through what we did for me to learn how I can debug myself next time

If I had more time:
- I would work on additional elements to enhance the game experience, such as audio, more attributes to choose from and personalise the game with my own cards
