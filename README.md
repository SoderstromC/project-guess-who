# Project Name

The assignment was to create a "Guess who?" game. A game where you win by guessing who the secret person is among an ensamble of different person cards. During the game you guess on personal attributes to filter among persons and reduce the options.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

This week external factors significantly limited the time I had to spend on the project, therefore prioritisation was key. 
I choose to prioritise learning and understanding the code and use of functions, arrays and objects. And to compromise on the style and additional add-ons. I decided I needed a clear plan and structure in order to reduce distractions. Due to the time limitations I also knew I would need imediate answers to questions to be able to progress within the timeline. Therefore receiving help from my partner who has previous experience coding. Usually I would prefer asking and answering questions among other students as it helps the learning process, but time constraints simply didn't allow it this week.

Plan:
- Spend majority of time on learning so that when I started coding I would be more efficient, learning through lessons, reviewing other students work, google etc.
- Plan the work: Define which problems I need to solve for, which problem to solve first and the following order, how to go about solving them 
- Coding approach - Test small learn fast. Small iterations, test it, debug or understand why it worked then move on to the next 
- Taking help from my partner to debug when stuck, followed by walking through what we did in order for me to learn how I can debug by myself next time

If I had more time:
- I would work on additional elements to enhance the game experience, such as audio, more attributes to choose from and personalise the game board with my own cards
